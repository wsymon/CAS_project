    //To do:

    //some funky ui system of all the available technologies henry is making and their prices that updates 
    //at the start of scene and when technology is 'developed' or brought using credits, in consideration of
    //preexisting developed technologies (which are stored within CurrentPlayerData and line 6 of each player file)
        //include probably a dropdown with options that are greyed/absent in another dropdown for viewing if previously developed

    //some function for the closing/opening of the canvas (which would shut the edit/view side menus uponing opening)
    //for the button press and the second button on the canvas itself

    //idk if this is too much for this silly game, but full knowledge of all technology from the start is idk
    //for altering the start technologies, see the "save name" function within title functions script from first scene
